# MultiRelaySelectionDFCoopCom
This project conducts some numerical experiments on the multi-relay selection based decode-and-forward cooperative communication.

The exact closed-form as well as two tight approximations of the outage probability of the multi-relay DF cooperative communication are first
studied.
