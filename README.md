# Multi_Relay_Selection_DF_Coop_Com
This project conducts some numerical experiments on the multi-relay selection based decode-and-forward cooperative communication.

The exact closed-form as well as two tight approximations of the outage probability of the multi-relay DF cooperative communication are first studied, and then the decentralized learning-based self-organized relay selection method is compared with other two existing schemes in terms of the energy efficiency.
