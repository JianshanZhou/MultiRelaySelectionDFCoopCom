# Multi-relay selection based DF cooperative communication 
This project conducts a series of simulation experiments on the multi-relay selection based decode-and-forward cooperative communication.

The exact closed-form of the outage probability as well as two tight approximations are first studied, and then the decentralized learning-based self-organized relay selection method is compared with other two existing schemes in terms of the energy efficiency.
